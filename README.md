# Porfolio Intro

### demo_projects
* __the_wall__
	* This is a simple project to demonstrate my abilities in developing a quick __MEAN stack__ application.
	* This fully modularized application focuses on the log-in and registration features which use __backend validations__ defined in the mongoose model schemas to successfully compare the requirements.
	* In addition to the backend validations, the application uses __bcrypt__ to generate hash before storing user passwords to prevent any unwanted attacks.
* __discussion_board__
	* This __MEAN stack__ application successfully demonstrates my skills to perform the four basic functions of  __CRUD__ (_Create, Read, Update, Delete_) operations.
	* By designing a __RESTful web API__, I have learned to create an application that is predictable and easy to use.
	* By taking the advantages of __AngularJS__, I have shown structured way of building a complete JavaScript application and more declarative way of connecting the models to the app's view.
	* Technologies used: _Node.js / Express / MongoDB / AngularJS / Mongoose / Bootstrap3 / JavaScript_

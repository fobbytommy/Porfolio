# Porfolio Intro

### demo_projects
* __the_wall__
	* This is a simple project to demonstrate my abilities in developing a quick __MEAN stack__ application.
	* This fully modularized application focuses on the log-in and registration features which use __backend validations__ defined in the mongoose model schemas to successfully compare the requirements.
	* In addition to the backend validations, the application uses __bcrypt__ to generate hash before storing user passwords to prevent unwanted attacks.
